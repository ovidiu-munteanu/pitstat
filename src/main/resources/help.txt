    --project-path, -PP     path to project you wish to run pistat analysis on
                                - by default set to current path

    --reports-path, -RP     output path for pitstat reports
                                - by default set to '<project-path>/target/pitstat-reports'

    --start-commit, -SC     most recent commit to start pitstat analysis from
                                - by default set to index (staged changes)
                                - <commit> may be specified as a short or long hash or in the format HEAD~[<value>]
                                  where <value> may be any positive integer number greater than zero, not exceeding
                                  the commit history of the current branch

    --end-commit,   -EC     oldest commit to finish pitstat analysis with
                                - by default set to parent commit of start commit
                                - <commit> may be specified as a short or long hash or in the format HEAD~[<value>]
                                  where <value> may be any positive integer number greater than zero, not exceeding
                                  the commit history of the current branch
                            NOTE: may not be used together with rollbacks option

    --rollbacks,    -R      run pitstat analysis rolling back specified number of commits from start commit
                                - by default set to 1 (parent of start commit)
                                - <value> may be any positive integer number greater than zero, not exceeding the
                                  commit history of the current branch; alternatively, the keyword 'max' may be
                                  used in which case pitstat will roll back through the entire branch history until
                                  the initial commit is reached
                            NOTE: may not be used together with end commit option

    --no-human,     -NH     do not created human readable output
                            NOTE:
                                - may not be used together with no machine option
                                - applies only to those statistics where both human readable and machine readable
                                output is available

    --zip-output,   -Z      compress machine readable output into individual zip archives
                            NOTE: may not be used together with no machine option

    --no-machine,   -NM     OPTION NOT AVAILABLE (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

                            do not created machine readable output
                            NOTE:
                                - may not be used together with the no human option
                                - applies only to those statistics where both machine readable and human readable
                                output is available

    --no-timestamp, -NT     do not create timestamp sub-directory in pitstat reports directory

    --shutdown,     -S      shutdown system on completion of pitstat analysis
                                - a delay of 1 minute is allowed between completion of analysis and system shutdown
                            WARNING: forcibly kills all running processes and shuts down system
